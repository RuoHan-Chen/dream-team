This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

### Running the Development Server with Docker

To get the development environment running, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

This will build the Docker image, install all dependencies, and start the development server.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Running a Local Development Server

If you prefer to run the project locally without Docker, you can follow these steps:

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
